        An object conforming to the AVCaptureMetadataOutputObjectsDelegate protocol that will receive metadata objects after they are captured.

     @discussion
        When new metadata objects are captured in the receiver's connection, they will be vended to the delegate using the captureOutput:didOutputMetadataObjects:fromConnection: delegate method. All delegate methods will be called on the specified dispatch queue.
     
        Clients that need to minimize the chances of metadata being dropped should specify a queue on which a sufficiently small amount of processing is performed along with receiving metadata objects.
     
        A serial dispatch queue must be used to guarantee that metadata objects will be delivered in order. The objectsCallbackQueue parameter may not be NULL, except when setting the objectsDelegate to nil.

        The value of this property is an NSArray of NSStrings corresponding to AVMetadataObjectType strings defined in AVMetadataObject.h -- one for each metadata object type supported by the receiver. Available metadata object types are dependent on the capabilities of the AVCaptureInputPort to which this receiver's AVCaptureConnection is connected. Clients may specify the types of objects they would like to process by calling setMetadataObjectTypes:. This property is key-value observable.

     @discussion
        AVCaptureMetadataOutput may detect and emit multiple metadata object types. For apps linked before iOS 7.0, the receiver defaults to capturing face metadata objects if supported (see -availableMetadataObjectTypes). For apps linked on or after iOS 7.0, the receiver captures no metadata objects by default. -setMetadataObjectTypes: throws an NSInvalidArgumentException if any elements in the array are not present in the -availableMetadataObjectTypes array.

     @discussion
        The value of this property is a CGRect that determines the receiver's rectangle of interest for each frame of video. The rectangle's origin is top left and is relative to the coordinate space of the device providing the metadata. Specifying a rectOfInterest may improve detection performance for certain types of metadata. The default value of this property is the value CGRectMake(0, 0, 1, 1). Metadata objects whose bounds do not intersect with the rectOfInterest will not be returned.
     
        As of iOS 13, this property can be set without requiring a lengthy rebuild of the session in which video preview is disrupted.

        Delegates receive this message whenever the output captures and emits new objects, as specified by its metadataObjectTypes property. Delegates can use the provided objects in conjunction with other APIs for further processing. This method will be called on the dispatch queue specified by the output's metadataObjectsCallbackQueue property. This method may be called frequently, so it must be efficient to prevent capture performance problems, including dropped metadata objects.
     
        Clients that need to reference metadata objects outside of the scope of this method must retain them and then release them when they are finished with them.
